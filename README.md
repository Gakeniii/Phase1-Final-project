# PROJECT NAME
- SOUHAIT (Wishlist)

## AUTHOR NAME
- SIFA GAKENI MURIITHI

# The Problem
- ## Problem 1
  This is a problem that I have faced personally and some of my close friends and family have experienced as well.
  Whereby you see an item that you really like maybe in a social media platform e.g. `An Instagram store` you don't pay too much attention to it and move on  
 later on you realize that you didn't save the item and now it's gone.
- ## Problem 2
  You see some things that you like from various online shops e.g. `Jumia` or `Amazon` and now you have a wishlist on both platforms maybe even 
 more and this can be confusing and tedious to keep moving from one wishlist to another
- ## Problem 3
  Gift giving especially among your loved ones, most people get stranded by what to get them, especially on their special days or a holiday such as Christmas

## Solution
I have created an app that solves all three problems listed above.
Just in case you are wondering `Souhait` is French for `Wish`.
- ## Problem 1
  You are ale to uplad the item that you liked, the price and the store that you saw it from without worrying about losing it again and you can purchase it whenever you want at you own time.
- ## Problem 2
  With my app, you are able to keep track of all the items on your wishlist without having to move from one platform to another which can be time-consuming and tedious as well
- ## Problem 3
  You are able to upload a gift that you would like to get for a loved one, maybe they mentioned something they might like or may have hinted it to you and planned for it in advance, this way on their special day or holiday you aren't stranded

  ## MVPs
- User Inputs their desired Item (POST)
- Deletes an Item that makes changes in the API(DELETE)
- Click button that leads you to the online store.

## Challenges
I did go through several challenges which included:
- Adding a section that allows the user to make changes to the gift, I tried to implement the PATCH route but it kept stalling my page and I was not able to do it so I removed the feature altogether.
- Deploying my server to make it public was a problem since I wasn't using a public API
- Pressure - pressure to make sure that the functionality is working as it should and hoping I don't develop very complex bugs during this time
- Self-doubt - doubting if my project is good enough and feeling like I'll fail but I choose to believe that failure is the beginning of true success
- 
## Future plans
I have plans to make major adjustments to my Application in the future and one of them my TM had recommended which is adding an extention to it, I'm also hoping to find a way to monetize it as well.
I would like to add more UI themes so that the user experience is great.
I also plan to add better functionality  but at the moment I'm not as comfortable with javascript as I would like to be, but that calls for me to pull up my socks and become better
