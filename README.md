PROJECT NAME : Souhait (WishList)

AUTHOR NAME : SIFA GAKENI MURIITHI

DESCRIPTION: 

An app made to create a wishlist for yourself or others maybe loved ones, you can upload an image and link to the online store that you would like to buy from.
I'm solving the problem of gift-giving and product buying, in that when you see a product you like you save it on the app for future reference. One may not have the funds to buy the product at that moment. You upload the product you would like and can be able to access it later, or remove it altogether. I will be building my API.
